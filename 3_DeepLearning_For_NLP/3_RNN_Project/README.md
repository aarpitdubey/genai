**Embedding layers** are a fundamental component in many deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). They play a crucial role in representing and encoding input data in a way that can be effectively processed by the neural network.

* Embedding layers are a type of neural network layer that maps discrete input features (e.g., words, tokens, or categorical variables) to a continuous, low-dimensional vector representation.
* The embedding layer learns a dense, distributed representation of the input features, where semantically similar features are mapped to nearby points in the vector space.
* The learned embeddings capture the underlying relationships and patterns in the input data, which can be leveraged by the subsequent layers of the neural network.
