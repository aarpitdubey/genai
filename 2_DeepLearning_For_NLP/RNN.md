# RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are neural networks **designed to identify patterns in sequences of data**.
- RNNs possess a unique feature: **they have loops** (self loop & passes information to other hidden layer neurons) in them, allowing information to persist these are called **feedback loop.**
- A feedback loop in an RNN allows information to be passed from one step to the next, maintaining a‘**memory**’of previous inputs
- RNNs are designed to handle sequential data like time series, text, and speech, using this **feedback loop to process sequential data and use recurrent connections**. This allows the network to have a sense of memory and to process sequences of data.
- This means, unlike ANNs, RNNs are uniquely suited for handling sequential data—data where the order of information matters. This sequential data, like text streams, audio clips, video clips, and time-series data, can be understood by RNNs **because each input corresponds to a time stamp in a sequence**
